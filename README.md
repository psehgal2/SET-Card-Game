# SET-Card-Game
This is inspired by the classic SET! Card game. A game consists of a board of cards. 
Each card has one of three options for 4 different "attributes": style, color, shape, count.


The goal of the game is to find as many "Sets" of 3 cards such that for each attribute, all cards
share the attribute or no cards share the attribute. 

The board is dynamically generated with JavaScript and uses event listeners to
support user interaction. It also includes a increasing/decreasing game
timer, as well as how to show/hide feedback to users with a 1 second delay.

To launch the website, download all of the files and open the html file.
